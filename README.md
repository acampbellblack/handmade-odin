# Handmade Odin
### A port of Handmade Hero to the Odin programming langauge.

This is the first 5 days. I have stopped before XInput as this was a bit awkward to implement in Odin. I recommend using SDL for input instead.

#### Changes
- Using snake_case and Ada_Case instead of Casey's naming conventions to make it more conventional with other Odin programs.

- No pointer arithmetic in Odin so I am indexing with multi-pointers instead.

- Code is formatted using the OLS formatter.

- Using VSCode build and debug scripts.

#### How to run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in VSCode.
3. Create a "build/" folder in the root of the repository.
4. Hit F5 or run the "Debug" configuration in the "Run and Debug" panel.

#### Requirements:
- Windows
- Must have the Odin compiler in your PATH
