# Handmade Odin
### A port of Handmade Hero to the Odin programming langauge.

Changes:
- Using snake_case and Ada_Case instead of Casey's naming conventions to make it more conventional with other Odin programs.

- No pointer arithmetic in Odin so I am indexing with multi-pointers instead.

- Code is formatted using the OLS formatter.

- Using VSCode build and debug scripts.
